## Instalation

Just need to clone the repo and make an

```
npm install
```

Then run

```
npm start
```

You'll have a react server running on port 3000 with everything ready and setup

## How it works?

You need to do nothing, that's the point, 500 pokemons will appear on the screen and they will crash to the walls until they learn how to avoid them. You can increase or decrease the time it takes for the AI learn using the little slider at the bottom, that will increase the speed on the game.
